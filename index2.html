            I know you‚Äôre busy right now, and I completely understand. But to me, the most important thing is you, your well-being, your happiness, and your dreams. I love the way you show me love, even when you don‚Äôt have much time for our relationship. It means the world to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm so proud of you, baby. Your passion for your career inspires me every day, and I will always be here to support you. No matter how busy life gets, my love for you will never change. I promise you that even if we don‚Äôt have as much time together as we‚Äôd like, my love will remain as strong as ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don‚Äôt worry, my love, one day, all the challenges and struggles you‚Äôre facing now will turn into blessings. You will look back and see how much you have grown, and I will be right here cheering you on. I pray that you find the strength to overcome every challenge or difficulty in your life, and I will always be your source of love, hope, and encouragement. Never give up, okay? Just keep praying, and trust me that everything will fall into place in God‚Äôs perfect time.

            I chose <strong>The Joker and the Queen</strong> by Ed Sheeran for you because it perfectly represents how I feel. The song is about love, loyalty, and appreciation like how the Joker who sees himself as unworthy is still loved by the Queen despite his flaws. Before I met you, I sometimes felt unworthy of love, but you changed that. Because of you, I learned to see myself as someone worthy and deserving of love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you, baby, for always being there for me. Thank you for choosing me, out of all the boys in the world. I appreciate every bit of love and effort you give, and I will always cherish it. I hope this little gift touches your heart and reminds you of how much I love and appreciate you.
        </p>
